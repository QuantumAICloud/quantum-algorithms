    "### 1.2 Classical Solution\n",
    "**TLDR;** _If we use the classical approach, we need to make at least $\\frac{2^n}{2} + 1$ queries in the worst case to make sure that the function is etiher balanced or constant. For example, for a $3$-bit string, if we checked $4$ out of the $8$ possible combinations, getting all $0$'s, it is still possible that the $5^{th}$ input returns a $1$ and $f(x)$ is balanced._\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, in the best case, two queries to the oracle can determine if the hidden Boolean function, $f(x)$, is balanced: \n",
    "e.g. if we get both $f(0,0,0,...)\\rightarrow 0$ and $f(1,0,0,...) \\rightarrow 1$, then we know the function is balanced as we have obtained the two different outputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case, if we continue to see the same output for each input we try, we will have to check exactly half of all possible inputs plus one in order to be certain that $f(x)$ is constant. Since the total number of possible inputs is $2^n$, this implies that we need $2^{n-1}+1$ trial inputs to be certain that $f(x)$ is constant in the worst case. For example, for a $4$-bit string, if we checked $8$ out of the $16$ possible combinations, getting all $0$'s, it is still possible that the $9^\\textrm{th}$ input returns a $1$ and $f(x)$ is balanced. Probabilistically, this is a very unlikely event. In fact, if we get the same result continually in succession, we can express the probability that the function is constant as a function of $k$ inputs as:\n",

    "### 2.3 Creating Quantum Oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore different ways to create a quantum oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constant Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For a constant function, the approach is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If \\(f(x) = 0\\), apply the $I$ gate to the qubit in register 2.\n",
    "2. If \\(f(x) = 1\\), apply the $X$ gate to the qubit in register 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balanced Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a balanced function, we can guarantee balance by performing a CNOT for each qubit in register 1, with the qubit in register 2 as the target. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balanced Circuit**\n",
    "<img src=\"images/deutsch_balanced1.svg\" alt=\"Balanced Circuit\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the circuit above, the top three qubits form the input register, and the bottom qubit is the output register. The corresponding input states and their respective outputs are shown in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input states that output 0 | Input states that output 1 |\n",
    "|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|\n",
    "|             000            |             001            |\n",
    "|             011            |             100            |\n",
    "|             101            |             010            |\n",
    "|             110            |             111            |\n",
    "\n",
    "We can modify the results while maintaining balance by wrapping selected controls in X-gates. For example, consider the following circuit and its results table:\n",
