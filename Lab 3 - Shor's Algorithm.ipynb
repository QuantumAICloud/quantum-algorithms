    "Shor's Algorithm, developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994, is a groundbreaking quantum algorithm that can efficiently solve the integer factorization problem. This problem underpins the security of widely used cryptographic systems, such as RSA encryption. The potential of Shor's Algorithm to break these cryptosystems has profound implications for the future of data security.\n",

    "You just managed to solve all the problem and factorized 15 using Shor's algorithm! You may think it is easy to factorize 15 by a classical computer, or even by your brain! However, Shor's algorithm can be extremely useful when the number gets exponentially larger, and quantum supremacy comes in. Nice work, and hope you enjoy your future quantum computing studies! For those who want to challenge themselves, here is another challenge for you:"
