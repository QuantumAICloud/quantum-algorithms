    "\n",
    "Grover's algorithm is one of the most famous quantum algorithms introduced by Lov Grover in 1996 \\[1\\]. It has initially been proposed for unstructured search problems, i.e. for finding a marked element in a unstructured database. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Grover's algorithm is now a subroutine to several other algorithms, such as Grover Adaptive Search \\[2\\]. For the details of Grover's algorithm, please see [Grover's Algorithm](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/blob/main/notebooks/ch-algorithms/grover.ipynb) in the Qiskit textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work with Qiskit, they're already implements the Grover's algorithm in the `Grover` class in their library. This class also includes the **generalized version** which is what we will try to understand and implement in a few next subcodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more advanced Grover's version that `Grover` class also includes, **Amplitude Amplification** \\[3\\], allows setting individual iterations and other meta-settings to Grover's algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "To run Grover's algorithm with the `Grover` class, firstly, we need to specify an oracle for the circuit of Grover's algorithm. In the following example, we use `QuantumCircuit` as the oracle of Grover's algorithm. However, there are several other class that we can use as the oracle of Grover's algorithm. We talk about them later in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the oracle for `Grover` must be a _phase-flip_ oracle. That is, it multiplies the amplitudes of the of \"good states\" by a factor of $-1$. We explain later how to convert a _bit-flip_ oracle to a phase-flip oracle."
